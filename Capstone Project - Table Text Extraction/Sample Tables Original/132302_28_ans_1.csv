1.,Low,- low strain zone lacking any significant structure or veining
2.,Weak,- infrequent narrow veining and/or foliation zones
3.,Weak-Mod,- partitioned zones of foliation to weak shearing ± veining
4.,Moderate,- zones of weak shearing with associated veining
5.,Mod-High,- shear zones with associated veining and minor hydraulic breccia development
6.,High,"- Strong penetrative shearing, often altered with biotite ± albite, with associated veining and hydraulic breccia development"
7.,Very High,- narrow fault / mylonite zones of maximum displacement
