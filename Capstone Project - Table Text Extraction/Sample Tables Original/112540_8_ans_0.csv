De,NNW-SSE extension,-,-,NNW-SSE extension
D1,Northerly directed thrusting,North-South regional shortening-> S over N low angle thrusts,North-South regional shortening-> south over north thrusts,North -south regional shortening -> S over N thrusts
D2,E-W compression -> steep N to NNW trending reverse faults and folds,ENE regional shortening -> NNW trending open upright folds reverse thrusts along fold limbs,"E-W shortening-> upright NNW trending, gently SE plunging folds.",E-W compression -> steep N to NNW trending reverse faults and folds
D3,NE-SW compression -> dextral reactivation of D2 faults. Others thrust,ESE-WNW shortening-> sinistral shear zones along NNW structures low angle thrusts,Oblique-sinistral wrench faulting reverse shear zones,ESE-WNW and NE-SW compressive events-> reactivation of reverse faults. Other thrust and faults variably dextral and sinistral movements.
D4,-,-,Dextral -reverse reactivation,Late brittle faulting and reactivation
