Abstract,,
Location:,TheKambaldaNickelProjectislocated19kmsouth-southeastofthetownshipofKambaldaand3.5kmsouthof,
"the main St Ives Administration office complex on the south side of Lake Lefroy, Kambalda, Western Australia.",,
Geology:,"The Kambalda Nickel Project is located within the Kambalda Domain, a subset of the Kalgoorlie Terrane as part of",
the Norseman-Wiluna greenstone belt. Stratigraphy is dominated by the Kalgoorlie Group volcanic rocks.,,
Work Done:,One diamond drillhole was completed as part of the EIS agreement to investigate the Kenilworth magnetic,
anomaly. Drillhole JAN22DD_004 was collared on tenement M15/1557 to a total depth of 1529.1m. Geochemical,,
analysis was conducted using 50g Fire Assay / ICP-OES analytical techniques for gold targets and 33 multi-element,,
"analysis using a four-acid digest with ICP-OES finish for Ni, Cu, Cr, Zn, Pb, Ag and 27 other elements. Semi-",,
quantitative multi-element pXRF readings at 1m intervals were taken from 47m to 1150m. Selected samples were,,
assayed using 48 multi-element analysis using a four-acid digest with ICP-MS finish for stratigraphic fingerprinting.,,

hole. Down Hole Transient Electro-Magnetic (DHTEM) survey was also conducted.,,
Results:,No shallow level magnetic differentiated dolerite was intercepted during drilling. Separate nearby drill holes to the,
north however passed through a magnetic dolerite within 2o0 m of surface. The nickeliferous ultramafic-basalt,,
"basement contact, originally interpreted to be as deep as 1,150 m below surface, was not reached during drilling",,
"due to drilling difficulties. It is deeper than anticipated, occurring at depths of more than 1,500 m. Multi-element",,
geochemistry and fertility ratios throughout the ultramafic unit show that the potential nickel prospectivity of the,,
"flows increase with depth. No anomalous gold values were found from any sediments, intrusives and areas of",,

further investigation. All assayed intervals returned <0.5 ppm gold. The lithologies encountered broadly follow the,,
"expected local stratigraphy, which from youngest to oldest include Paringa Basalt, Kapai Slate, Devon Consols",,
"Basalt, Kambalda Komatite. No Defiance Dolerite was present. Geochemical identification of Lunnon Basalt higher",,
than expected in stratigraphy is perhaps one of the most important results.,,
Conclusion:,The Kenilworth magnetic anomaly is most likely the result of a shallow level magnetic differentiated dolerite,
immediately to the north but not intersected in this EIs drillhole. The nickel fertility data and ultramafic facies,,
"modelling suggest nickel mineralised troughs may still exist at depths greater than that drilled. In addition, no",,
drilling to date has intersected the basal contact in this Jan-East Cooee Corridor which remains undetected and,,
under-explored.,,
