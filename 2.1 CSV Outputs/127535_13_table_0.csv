 Event, Type, Direction, Style, Significant features and associations
 D1, Extension," ENE-
WSW"," Rifting leads to
NNW-trending linear
structures"," Syn-volcanic extensional faults
including the nickel shoots at
Kambalda."
 D2, Contraction," ENE-
WSW"," NNW upright
folding and ENE
thrust faulting", Terminates greenstone volcanism.
 D3, Extension, ," Development of
extensional core
complexes and
domes."," Formation of granite-cored domes.
Prepares the EYC for gold endowment."
 D4, Contraction," Stress
switch"," Sinistral strike-slip
faulting
Reactivation of D3
structures"," Onset of the most endowed period of
gold mineralisation"
 D4a, Contraction," ENE-
WSW"," NNW upright
folding and ENE
thrust faulting"," All events up to and including D4a
involve block movements up and down
to NE or SW within a NNW- to NW-
oriented architectural framework."
 D4b, Contraction," WNW-
ESE"," NNW sinistral strike-
slip shearing and
(ESE) thrusting"," Significant change in regional stress
field: obliquity with pre-existing
architecture. New network of stress
heterogeneity. Most gold deposited
during D4b. Regionally pervasive."
 D5, Contraction, NE-SW," N to NNE dextral
strike-slip faulting,
mostly brittle
structures."," Establishment of a regionally
consistent NE-SW oriented shortening
vector.

In Kambalda: NNE-trending brittle
faulting inc. Alpha Island Fault."
 D6," Minor
extension", ," Low-strain vertical
shortening and
horizontal extension",
