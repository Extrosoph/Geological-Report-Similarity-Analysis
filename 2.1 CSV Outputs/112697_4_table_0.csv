Abstract,,
Location:,"The Juntion South Project, comprising exploration licence E15/1427, is located 45km southeast of Kambalda and",
"30km east of Widgiemooltha, within the Coolgardie Mineral Field (Coolgardie District 15), Western Australia.",,
Access to the area is either by the Binneringie gravel road from Widgiemooltha or the private St Ives Spur Road,,
fromKambaldavia the LakeLefroy causeway.,,
Geology:,Junction South is located within the Archaean Kambalda Domain of the Kalgoorlie Terrane of Western Australia.,
"Structurally, the Junction South area represents the southern extension of the Kambalda Anticline that is bounded to",,
the east by the Boulder-Lefroy Fault and to the west by the Bluebush ultramafic sequence. The Archaean,,
stratigraphy at Junction South can be directly correlated to that of the Kambalda nickel mining area,,
The Republican Thrust bisects E15/142/ with a SW-NE strike orientation and has been interpreted as a major D1,,
thrust fault purportedly deformed during the D2 east-west compression to create the NW-axially orientated,,
Democrat Anticline and Syncline. The southern portion of E15/1427 contains a sequence of mafic and ultramafic,,
"rocks, with associated meta-sedimentary rocks, that lie above the Republican Thrust. North of the Republican Thrust",,
is a sequence of felsic volcanic-derived clastic sedimentary rocks assigned to the Black Flag Beds.,,
Work Done:,Past exploration reports were reviewed and information for 756 historical drill holes was captured in summary,
"format. The drilling data was interpreted in conjunction with historical geological maps, soil geochemistry plans and",,
"geophysical images, resulting in the identification of several exploration targets for nickel, gold, copper and cobalt.",,
"This work has been compiled in an Information Memorandum, detailing the exploration potential of the Project.",,
Geological reconnaissance was carried out over most of the tenement and a total of 28 surface samples were,,
collected and analysed.,,
Results:,"The review of historical work has highlighted several compelling, relatively shallow exploration",
"targets that warrant drilling such as the Remy gold prospect, the Croser-Moet nickel-cobalt prospect and the Remy",,
"cobalt MMI/DDIP anomaly, as well as other more grassroots or conceptual targets requiring another phase of target",,
definition work.,,
"The results of rock chip sampling of pegmatites of pegmatite float were disappointing, with a maximum value of",,
"253ppm Li obtained from sample ER010. Sampling in the Remy prospect area confirmed elevated levels of Au, As,",,
"Cu, Pb and Zn associated with mafic and possible interflow sedimentary rocks, consistent with historical drilling",,
results from this region.,,
Conclusion:,"The Junction South project area contains several gold, nickel, cobalt, and copper exploration targets which warrant",
further work.,,
"The Remy gold prospect, with historical drill intersections of 4m @ 4.69g/t Au and 4m @ 4.57g/t Au, is the highest",,
priority gold target.,Analysis of historical drilling reveals the potential for mineralised structures which are open or,
